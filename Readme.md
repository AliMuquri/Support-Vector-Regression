# SupportVectorRegression

## Project Description
In this project a custom SVR is created with Tensorflow Module and Keras Model. A complete custom fit, training_step and validation step was implemented in this project.
Moreover, a custom Support Vector Loss was also implemented.

### Features
* Custom SVR
* Custom SV Loss
* Utilizing Tensorflow and Keras

## Getting Started

Install all modules provided in requirments.txt

pip install -r requirments.txt

## Usage

### Standalone usage:
The SupportVectorRegression.py can be used seperatly

### Integration:
The main_program.py can be adjusted to serve your dataset. The datapipeline has only been set up for loading data to the pipeline.
